# Refactor code: Not timed (good to get it back within 24 hours)

# An intern has provided the code below to update the version number
# within two different files.
# The intern is has left and you need to review and improve the code before
# submitting to source control.
# Please do not be constrained by the existing code (i.e. you don't have
# to keep the same function names, structure)
# Aim for production quality 'best-practice/clean' code
