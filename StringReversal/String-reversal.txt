# PROBLEM DEFINITION
# ------------------
# Reverse each word in the input string.
# The order of the words will be unchanged.
# A word is made up of letters and/or numbers.
# Other characters (spaces, punctuation) will not be reversed.
#
# NOTES
# ------
# Write production quality code
# We prefer clarity over performance (though if you can achieve both - great!)
# You can use the language that best highlights your programming ability
#    the template below is Python - but you can write
#    in Java/C++/C#/Haskell/etc if you feel you solve the
#    problem better in that language.
# A working solution is preferred (assert in main() should succeed)
# Bonus points for additional good tests


def reverse_each_word(sentence):
    # TODO: Implement this function
    pass


def main():
    # TODO: Feel free to re-write as necessary - but keep this test string
    test_str = "Stri_ng;-%   2b$#e reversed"
    rev_str = reverse_each_word(test_str)
    print(rev_str)
    assert rev_str == "irtS_gn;-%   b2$#e desrever"
